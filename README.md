I was told that I am not a designer and I should stop involving myself in any form of design projects or any activity that requires creativity.

**I didn't stop. ‚úãüèª**

Kumusta, I am Art, a Creative Front-End Web Developer, UI Designer, UX Practitioner, and a former Independent Web Development and Design Consultant from the Philippines.

Throughout my career as a Web Developer, I found myself instinctively providing solutions for development and design problems using a technical and creative approach, which then led me to consider a career in consultancy, but during my time as a team lead/consultant, I felt like I wanted to do more, I wanted to create more.

I quit my job as a consultant, applied for a software engineering position, and currently open for web design and/or development projects, it would be fun to help turn your creative ideas into reality. ‚ö°
