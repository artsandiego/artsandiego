### Hello there

Welcome to my Github page! ✨

I'm a Web Dev guy from the Philippines who happens to be obsessed with UI design and UX practice.

Most of my works revolve around coding, however, one day, I decided to incorporate Web Development skills and my interest in UI Design, now I'm working as a Creative Front-End Web Developer, UI Designer, UX Practitioner, and a Consultant 🎉

I'm currently working on [Kakutasu JS](https://github.com/crtved/kakutasu.js) a MERN Stack boilerplate 🔥
