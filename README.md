I am [Art](https://artsandiego.dev), a Creative Front-End Web Developer, UI Designer, UX Practitioner, and a former Independent Web Development and Design Consultant from the Philippines.

Throughout my career as a Web Developer, I found myself instinctively providing solutions for development and design problems using a technical and creative approach, which then led me to consider a career in consultancy, but during my time as a team lead/consultant, I felt like I wanted to do more, I wanted to create more.

I quit my job as a consultant, and focused on my freelance career as a UI Designer and Web/App Developer. Feel free to contact me for your projects! it would be fun to help turn your creative ideas into reality. ⚡
