I was told that I am not creative enough and I should stop involving myself in any form of design projects or activities.

**I didn't stop. ✋🏻**

Kumusta, I am Art, a Creative Front-End Web Developer, UI Designer, UX Practitioner and a former Independent Web Development and Design Consultant from the Philippines.

Throughout my career as a Web Developer, I found myself instinctively providing digital solutions using creative approach which led me to choose a career in consultancy, but I'm also open for freelance projects, it would be fun to help turn your creative ideas into reality. ⚡
